### Ignoring events fired by certain elements [#4600](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4600)

Events are logged in browser's console.

### Case 1: Events are ignored and they are not handled by default listeners.
1. Move mouse cursor over a left container named `Ignored container with data-cke-ignore-events="true"`.
2. When cursor is already there, start moving it around within container boundaries, start typing in text field and start clicking on text field and button.
3. Click on the button.

**Expected results**: Only then, when the mouse cursor is over the left container, new logs will stop appearing in the console. Clicking inside it, typing in text field and moving mouse cursor inside the container boundaries should not be logged in the console. The `click` event after clicking the button also should not be logged in the console. The `imageLoaded` event from <img> element from ignored container also should not be logged in the console.

One note for `focus` nad `blur` events: they will be logged in the console, but only when container lost focus or gets it back, respectively.

### Case 2: Events are not ignored and they are handled by default listeners.
1. Move mouse cursor over a right container named `Regular container`.
2. When cursor is already there, start moving it around within container boundaries, start typing in text field and start clicking on text field and button.
3. Click on the button.

**Expected results**: Events should be logged in the console. It shouldn't be possible to focus the text field and type anything there. The `click` event after clicking the button should be logged in the console (with `mousedown` and `mouseup` events). The `imageLoaded` event also should be logged in the console - its target element should point to the <img> element from regular container.
